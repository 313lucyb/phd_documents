# phd_documents

This repository contains the supplementary results (Chapters 2 and 4) and coding scripts (Chapters 3 and 4) for the contents presented within my PhD thesis. These files are presented here, instead of the thesis document itself, due to the size of the files presented. 

## Repository contents

1. The reference list that informed the methodological review results, presented in Chapter 2, can be found in the **review_data** folder. 
2. The data cleaning scripts for the empirical analysis, presented in Chapter 3, can be found in the **empirical_review/data_cleaning** folder.
3. The model fitting and evaluation scripts for the empirical comparison of methods, presented in Chapter 3, can be found in the **empirical_review/modelling_and_evaluation** folder. 
4. The R scripts and qsub files submitted to the shared computing facility for the simulation study (Chapter 4) can be found in the **simulation_code** folder.  
5. The simulation output for predictive performance, optimism, computational times, and model fitting failures for each scenario (Chapter 4) are provided in the **simulation_output** folder (the stability datasets were too large to upload onto github).  
6. The supplementary plots for the simulation (Chapter 4), which were not presented as part of Thesis Chapter 4 are provided in the **simulation_plots**
